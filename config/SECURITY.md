# ⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE ⚠️

## Configuration File Security

### 📁 Files in This Directory

**✅ SAFE TO COMMIT (Contains only placeholder values):**
- `environment.js` - Template with placeholder values
- `environment.ts` - Template with placeholder values  
- `sync-env.js` - Automation script (no secrets)
- `README.md` - Documentation

**🚫 NEVER COMMIT (Would contain real keys):**
- `environment.local.js` - Local config with real keys
- `environment.local.ts` - Local config with real keys
- `environment.production.js` - Production config with real keys
- `environment.production.ts` - Production config with real keys
- Any `.env` files in this directory

### 🔐 Best Practices

1. **For Development:**
   - Keep using the template files with placeholders
   - Set real keys via environment variables or DigitalOcean dashboard
   - Never put real keys in tracked files

2. **For Production:**
   - Use DigitalOcean App Platform environment variables
   - Or create local config files (they're ignored by git)
   - Never commit production keys

3. **For Team Collaboration:**
   - Share placeholder values in templates
   - Share real keys securely (not via git)
   - Each developer sets their own keys locally

### 🛡️ Current Security Status

- ✅ Template files are tracked with safe placeholder values
- ✅ `.gitignore` prevents committing files with real keys
- ✅ Production keys should be set via DigitalOcean dashboard
- ✅ Local development keys can be set via environment variables

### 🚨 If You Accidentally Commit Real Keys

1. **Immediately revoke/regenerate** all exposed keys
2. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
3. Update all deployment configurations with new keys
4. Review this security notice again
